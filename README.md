# Link-a-roo

A Chrome extension for parameterized shortcuts/bookmarks: highlight "Tommy" anywhere, press a key, and search for "Tommy" in Gmail — in a new tab or the one you already have open.

Link-a-roo is keyboard-first and permission-light. Nothing runs on any page until you invoke it, and it needs no access to your browsing data at install.

## Features

- **A panel in your toolbar**: click the Link-a-roo icon (or press the shortcut) to open a search box with your highlighted text already filled in, then pick where to send it.
- **Configurable destinations**: URL templates with a `{term}` placeholder, each with its own label. Add and edit them right in the panel.
- **Quick-search shortcuts**: highlight text and press a slot shortcut to search one of your first five destinations without opening anything.
- **Right-click context menu**: highlight text on any page → search it in any configured destination.
- **Tab reuse**: Link-a-roo reopens the destination in an existing tab on that site instead of piling up duplicates. Toggle it off per destination.

Link-a-roo deliberately keeps no history of what you search — it just opens URLs. An early version had a remember-searches feature that was split out into a separate companion extension; updating clears any search terms it left behind in local storage.

## Packaging

`./package.sh` builds the Chrome Web Store upload zip into `dist/`, named from the
version in `manifest.json`. It ships only what the extension loads — `manifest.json`,
`icons/`, `src/`, `fonts/` — and checks that the manifest landed at the archive root,
which the store requires.

`dist/` is gitignored. It is also the place to keep store screenshots and any scratch
files used to compose them; everything in it is reproducible.

## Privacy

Everything Link-a-roo stores lives in `chrome.storage.local` on your own device. It has
no server, no analytics, and makes no network requests of its own. See
[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Permissions

Link-a-roo uses `activeTab`: it can only read a page at the moment you invoke it, on that one tab, and the grant expires on navigation. There are no host permissions and no content scripts. The `tabs` permission is used solely to find an existing tab to reuse instead of opening a duplicate.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder
5. Pin the Link-a-roo icon in your Chrome toolbar (puzzle-piece menu → pin Link-a-roo)

Google and Gmail are seeded as default destinations so the panel does something useful immediately, and the settings page opens on first install with a walkthrough.

To pick up new changes after a `git pull`, go to `chrome://extensions` and click the reload icon on the Link-a-roo card.

## Using it

1. **Add a destination** — open the panel, go to **Destinations**, press **+**. The URL template is the trick: run a search on the site, copy the resulting URL, and replace your search words with `{term}`.
   - `https://www.google.com/search?q={term}`
   - `https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/{term}`
   - `https://github.com/search?q={term}&type=issues`
2. **Highlight text on any page** — a name, an email address, a ticket ID.
3. **Search it** — open the panel (your selection is pre-filled) and click a destination, or right-click → **Link-a-roo**, or press a quick-search shortcut.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Chrome owns these bindings — that's why Link-a-roo needs no access to the sites you visit. View them on the settings page; change them at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`. Defaults:

- **Open the Link-a-roo panel** — `Ctrl+Shift+S` (`⌘⇧S` on Mac)
- **Quick-search slots 1–3** — `Alt+1` / `Alt+2` / `Alt+3` (`⌥1`–`⌥3` on Mac)
- **Quick-search slots 4 and 5** — unbound by default; assign keys (e.g. `Alt+4` / `Alt+5`) if you want them

Chrome allows an extension to suggest at most four default keys, and Link-a-roo spends them on opening the panel plus the first three slots — hence slots 4 and 5 arriving unbound rather than unavailable.

Quick-search slots map to your first five destinations, in panel order.

### Destination options

- **Label** — the destination's name in the panel.
- **URL template** — a URL with `{term}` as the search placeholder.
- **Encoding** — how `{term}` is encoded into the URL:
  - **Plain** (URL-encode) — works for most search URLs
  - **Salesforce componentDef (base64)** — wraps the term in a Lightning search payload and base64-encodes it. Use with a template like `https://YOUR-INSTANCE.lightning.force.com/one/one.app#{term}`.
  - **Raw** — substitute the term verbatim
- **Always open a new tab** — off by default, so Link-a-roo reuses an existing tab on that hostname.

## Layout

- `manifest.json` — MV3 manifest: popup, background worker, and the Chrome-managed commands.
- `src/popup.*` — the toolbar panel: search, destination list, and the add/edit form.
- `src/options.*` — settings page: getting started and shortcut bindings.
- `src/background.js` — context menus, quick-search commands, tab reuse.
- `src/storage.js` — shared settings/URL helpers.
